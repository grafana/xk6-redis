# xk6-redis

This is a Redis client library for [k6](https://github.com/grafana/k6),
implemented as an extension using the [xk6](https://github.com/grafana/xk6) system.

| :exclamation: This extension is under heavy development, and breaking changes are possible. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

## Build

This extension is available as an [experimental k6 module](https://k6.io/docs/javascript-api/k6-experimental/redis/) since k6 v0.40.0, so you don't need to build it with xk6 yourself, and can use it with the main k6 binary. Note that your script must import `k6/experimental/redis` instead of `k6/x/redis` if you're using the module bundled in k6.

However, if you prefer to build it from source using xk6, first ensure you have the prerequisites:

- [Go toolchain](https://go101.org/article/go-toolchain.html)
- Git

Then:

1. Install `xk6`:
  ```shell
  go install go.k6.io/xk6/cmd/xk6@latest
  ```

2. Build the binary:
  ```shell
  xk6 build --with github.com/grafana/xk6-redis
  ```

## Usage

This extension exposes a [promise](https://javascript.info/promise-basics)-based API. As opposed to most other current k6 modules and extensions, who operate in a synchronous manner,
xk6-redis operates in an asynchronous manner. In practice, this means that using the Redis client's methods won't block the execution of the test,
and that the test will continue to run even if the Redis client is not ready to respond to the request.

One potential caveat introduced by this new execution model, is that to depend on operations against Redis, all following operations
should be made in the context of a [promise chain](https://javascript.info/promise-chaining). As demonstrated in the examples below, whenever there is a dependency on a Redis
operation result or return value, the operation, should be wrapped in a promise itself. That way, a user can perform asynchronous interactions
with Redis in a seemingly synchronous manner.

For instance, if you were to depend on values stored in Redis to perform HTTP calls, those HTTP calls should be made in the context of the Redis promise chain:

```javascript
// Instantiate a new Redis client using a URL.
// The connection will be established on the first command call.
const client = new redis.Client('redis://localhost:6379');

export default function() {
    // Once the SRANDMEMBER operation is succesfull,
    // it resolves the promise and returns the random
    // set member value to the caller of the resolve callback.
    //
    // The next promise performs the synchronous HTTP call, and
    // returns a promise to the next operation, which uses the
    // passed URL value to store some data in redis.
    client.srandmember('client_ids')
        .then((randomID) => {
            const url = `https://my.url/${randomID}`
            const res = http.get(url)

            // Do something with the result...

            // return a promise resolving to the URL
            return url
        })
        .then((url) => client.hincrby('k6_crocodile_fetched', url, 1));
}
```

You can see more complete examples in the [/examples](/examples) directory.


### Single-node client

As shown in the above example, the simplest way to create a new `Client` instance that connects to a single Redis server is by passing a URL string. It must be in the format:

```
redis[s]://[[username][:password]@][host][:port][/db-number]
```

A client can also be instantiated using an object, for more flexibility:
```javascript
const client = new redis.Client({
  socket: {
    host: 'localhost',
    port: 6379,
  },
  username: 'someusername',
  password: 'somepassword',
});
```


### Cluster client

You can connect to a cluster of Redis servers by using the `cluster` property, and passing 2 or more node URLs:
```javascript
const client = new redis.Client({
  cluster: {
    // Cluster options
    maxRedirects: 3,
    readOnly: true,
    routeByLatency: true,
    routeRandomly: true,
    nodes: ['redis://host1:6379', 'redis://host2:6379']
  }
});
```

Or the same as above, but using node objects:
```javascript
const client = new redis.Client({
  cluster: {
    nodes: [
      {
        socket: {
          host: 'host1',
          port: 6379,
        }
      },
      {
        socket: {
          host: 'host2',
          port: 6379,
        }
      }
    ]
  }
});
```


### Sentinel (failover) client

A [Redis Sentinel](https://redis.io/docs/management/sentinel/) provides high availability features, as an alternative to a Redis cluster.

You can connect to a sentinel instance by setting additional options in the object passed to the `Client` constructor:
```javascript
const client = new redis.Client({
  username: 'someusername',
  password: 'somepassword',
  socket: {
    host: 'localhost',
    port: 6379,
  },
  // Sentinel options
  masterName: 'masterhost',
  sentinelUsername: 'sentineluser',
  sentinelPassword: 'sentinelpass',
});
```


### TLS

A TLS connection can be established in a couple of ways.

If the server has a certificate signed by a public Certificate Authority, you can use the `rediss` URL scheme:
```javascript
const client = new redis.Client('rediss://example.com');
```

Otherwise, you can supply your own self-signed certificate in PEM format using the `socket.tls` object:
```javascript
const client = new redis.Client({
  socket: {
    host: 'localhost',
    port: 6379,
    tls: {
      ca: [open('ca.crt')],
    }
  },
});
```

Note that for self-signed certificates, [k6's `insecureSkipTLSVerify` option](https://k6.io/docs/using-k6/k6-options/reference/#insecure-skip-tls-verify) must be enabled (set to `true`).


### TLS client authentication (mTLS)

You can also enable mTLS by setting two additional properties in the `socket.tls` object:

```javascript
const client = new redis.Client({
  socket: {
    host: 'localhost',
    port: 6379,
    tls: {
      ca: [open('ca.crt')],
      cert: open('client.crt'),  // client certificate
      key: open('client.key'),   // client private key
    }
  },
});
```


## API

xk6-redis exposes a subset of Redis' [commands](https://redis.io/commands) the core team judged relevant in the context of k6 scripts.

### key/value operations

| Redis Command | Module function signature | Description | Returns |
| ------------- | :------------------------ | :---------- | :------ |
| **SET**       | `set(key: string, value: any, expiration: number) => Promise<string>` | Set `key` to hold `value`, with a time to live equal to `expiration` (expressed in seconds). If `key` already holds a value, it is overwritten.                                                                       | On **success**, the promise **resolves** with `"OK"`. If the provided `value` is not of a supported type, the promise is **rejected** with an error.                                                                                        |
| **GET**       | `get(key: string) => Promise<string>`                                 | Get the value of `key`.                                                                                                                                                                                               | On **success**, the promise **resolves** with the value of `key`. If `key` does not exist, the promise is **rejected** with an error.                                                                                                       |
| **GETSET**    | `getSet(key: string, value: any) => Promise<string>`                  | Atomically sets `key` to `value` and returns the old value stored at `key`. If `key` exists but does not hold a string value, or the provided `value` is not a supported type, the promise is rejected with an error. | On **success**, the promise **resolves** with the old value stored at `key`. If `key` does not exist, the promise is rejected with an error.                                                                                                |
| **DEL**       | `del(keys: string[]) => Promise<number>`                              | Removes the specified keys. A key is ignored if it does not exist. Returns the number of keys that were removed.                                                                                                      | On **success**, the promise **resolves** with the number of keys that were removed.                                                                                                                                                         |
| **GETDEL**    | `getDel(key: string) => Promise<string>`                              | Get the value of `key` and delete the key. This functionality is similar to `get`, except for the fact that it also deletes the key on success.                                                                       | On **success**, the promise **resolves** with the value of `key`. If the key does not exist, the promise is **rejected** with an error.                                                                                                     |
| **EXISTS**    | `exists(keys: string[]) => Promise<number>`                           | Returns the number of `key` arguments that exist. Note that if the same existing key is mentioned in the argument multiple times, it will be counted multiple times.                                                  | On **success**, the promise **resolves** with the number of keys that exist from those specified as arguments.                                                                                                                              |
| **INCR**      | `incr(key: string) => Promise<number>`                                | Increments the number stored at `key` by one. If the key does not exist, it is set to zero before performing the operation.  Returns the value of key after the increment.                                            | **success**, the promise **resolves** with the value of `key` after the increment. If the key contains a value of the wrong type, or contains a string that cannot be represented as an integer, the promise is **rejected** with an error. |
| **INCRBY**    | `incrby(key: string, increment: number) => Promise<number>`           | Increments the number stored at `key` by `increment`. If the key does not exist, it is set to zero before performing the operation.                                                                                   | On **success**, the promise **resolves** with . If the key contains a value of the wrong type, or contains a string that cannot be represented as an integer, the promise is **rejected** with an error.                                    |
| **DECR**      | `decr(key: string) => Promise<number>`                                | Decrements the number stored at `key` by one. If the key does not exist, it is set to zero before performing the operation                                                                                            | On **success**, the promise **resolves** with . If the key contains a value of the wrong type, or contains a string that cannot be represented as an integer, the promise is **rejected** with an error.                                    |
| **DECRBY**    | `decrby(key: string, decrement: number) => Promise<number>`           | Decrements the number stored at `key` by `decrement`. If the key does not exist, it is set to zero before performing the operation.                                                                                   | On **success**, the promise **resolves** with . If the key contains a value of the wrong type, or contains a string that cannot be represented as an integer, the promise is **rejected** with an error.                                    |
| **RANDOMKEY** | `randomKey() => string`                                               | Returns a random key.                                                                                                                                                                                                 | On **success**, the promise **resolves** with the random key.  If the database is empty, the promise is **rejected** with an error.                                                                                                         |
| **MGET**      | `mget(keys: string[]) => Promise<any[]>)`                             | Returns the values of all specified keys. For every key that does not hold a string value, or does not exist, the value `null` will be returned.                                                                      | On **success**, the promise **resolves** with the list of values at the specified keys.                                                                                                                                                     |
| **EXPIRE**    | `expire(key: string, seconds: number) => Promise<boolean>`            | Sets a timeout on key, after which the key will automatically be deleted. Note that calling Expire with a non-positive timeout will result in the key being deleted rather than expired.                              | On **success**, the promise **resolves** with `true` if the timeout was set, and `false` if the timeout wasn't set.                                                                                                                         |
| **TTL**       | `ttl(key: string) => Promise<number>`                                 | Returns the remaining time to live of a key that has a timeout.                                                                                                                                                       | On **success**, the promise **resolves** with the TTL value in seconds.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **PERSIST**   | `persist(key: string) => Promise<boolean>`                            | Removes the existing timeout on key.                                                                                                                                                                                  | On **success**, the promise **resolves** with `true` if the timeout was removed, `false` otherwise.                                                                                                                                         |

### List field operations

| Redis Command | Module function signature | Description | Returns |
| ------------- | :------------------------ | :---------- | :------ |
| **LPUSH**     | `lpsuh(key: string, values: any[]) => Promise<number>`                  | Inserts all the specified values at the head of the list stored at `key`. If `key` does not exist, it is created as empty list before performing the push operations. When `key` holds a value that is not a list, and error is returned.                                                          | On **success**, the promise **resolves** with the lenght of the list after the push operations.                                                                            |
| **RPUSH**     | `rpush(key: string, values: any[]) => Promise<number>`                  | Inserts all the specified values at the tail of the list stored at `key`. If `key` does not exist, it is created as empty list before performing the push operations.                                                                                                                              | On **success**, the promise **resolves** with the length of the list after the push operation.                                                                             |
| **LPOP**      | `lpop(key: string) => Promise<string>`                                  | Removes and returns the first element of the list stored at `key`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | On **success**, the promise **resolves** with the value of the first element. If the list does not exist, the promise is **rejected** with an error.                       |
| **RPOP**      | `rpop(key: string) => Promise<string>`                                  | Removes and returns the last element of the list stored at `key`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | On **success**, the promise **resolves** with the value of the last element. If the list does not exist, the promise is **rejected** with an error.                        |
| **LRANGE**    | `lrange(key: string, start: number, stop: number) => Promise<string[]>` | Returns the specified elements of the list stored at `key`. The offsets start and stop are zero-based indexes. These offsets can be negative numbers, where they indicate offsets starting at the end of the list.                                                                                 | On **success**, the promise **resolves** with the list of elements in the specified range.                                                                                 |
| **LINDEX**    | `lindex(key: string, start: number, stop: number) => Promise<string>`   | Returns the specified element of the list stored at `key`. The index is zero-based. Negative indices can be used to designate elements starting at the tail of the list.                                                                                                                           | On **success**, the promise **resolves** with the requested element. If the list does not exist, or the index is out of bounds, the promise is **rejected** with an error. |
| **LSET**      | `lset(key: string, index: number, element: string)`                     | Sets the list element at `index` to `element`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | On **success**, the promise **resolves** with `"OK"`. If the list does not exist, or the index is out of bounds, the promise is **rejected** with an error.                |
| **LREM**      | `lrem(key: string, count: number, value: string) => Promise<number>`    | Removes the first `count` occurrences of `value` from the list stored at `key`. If `count` is positive, elements are removed from the beginning of the list. If `count` is negative, elements are removed from the end of the list. If `count` is zero, all elements matching `value` are removed. | On **success**, the promise **resolves** with the number of removed elements. If the list does not exist, the promise is **rejected** with an error.                       |
| **LLEN**      | `llen(key: string) => Promise<number>`                                  | Returns the length of the list stored at `key`. If `key` does not exist, it is interpreted as an empty list and 0 is returned.                                                                                                                                                                     | On **success**, the promise **resolves** with the length of the list at `key`. If the list does not exist, the promise is **rejected** with an error.                      |

### Hash field operations
